In this work, we proposed a new hybridization strategy  for designing more efficient hybrid algorithms.

My thesis work was the design and development of a web system for the Assessment and Management of Information Security Risk based on MAGERIT methodology and ISO 27005 standard. From 2015 to the present, I have worked for excellent software companies around the world such as <a href=\"https://www.isofact.com/\">iSOFACT (Spain)</a>, <a href=\"http://evomatik.com/\">Evomatik (Mexico)</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.unosquare.com/\">Unosquare (USA)</a> as a frontend developer.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n         </div>\r\n         </CSSTransition>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport profile from \"../../assets/profile.jpg\"\r\nimport { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group'\r\nimport './SkillsPage.scss'\r\nimport '../../assets/styles/animations.scss'\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default class SkillsPage extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <CSSTransition\r\n      in={true}\r\n      appear={true}\r\n      timeout={800}\r\n      classNames=\"fade\"\r\n    >\r\n         <div className=\"Skills-page\">\r\n         <img src={profile} className=\"profile-image\"/>\r\n          <p>\r\n          \"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
